# Olam Stakeholder Presentation Script

## Slide 1: Title - Olam: Exploring Possibilities for Malayalam Lexicography

**What you're showing:** Opening slide with title and subtitle "Exploring Possibilities"

**What to say:**
"Thank you for being here. Today we're exploring what Olam could become. This is not a development proposal—we're here to share possibilities and hear your perspectives. Olam has served the Malayalam community since 2010, and we want to discuss its future direction together."

**Key point:** Set consultative tone from the start.

---

## Slide 2: The Eight Functions of a Dictionary

**What you're showing:** Academic foundation - 8 core dictionary functions with citations

**What to say:**
"Before we talk about Olam specifically, let's ground ourselves in what dictionaries actually do. Dictionary research identifies eight core functions—from helping you spell a word correctly, to understanding its meaning, to knowing how to pronounce it. These aren't features we invented; these come from decades of lexicography research."

**Key point:** Establish that we're building on academic research, not making up features.

**If asked about citations:** "These are from leading lexicographers—Landau, Zgusta, Fellbaum, and others. The full references are in the slide."

---

## Slide 3: Malayalam Dictionary Timeline (1849-2025)

**What you're showing:** Timeline from Bailey 1849 through Olam 2025

**What to say:**
"Malayalam lexicography has a rich 175-year history. It started with Bailey's work in 1849, then Gundert's foundational dictionary in 1872—which we still reference today. Fast forward to 2010, Olam brought Malayalam dictionaries online. And now we're asking: what should the next evolution look like?"

**Key point:** We're part of a long tradition of serving Malayalam language learners and scholars.

**Note the dates:**
- Bailey: 1849
- Gundert: 1872 (the famous one)
- Zacharias: 1907
- Sabdatharavali: 1930
- WordNet: 2006
- Olam 1.0: 2010

---

## Slide 4: Olam 1.0 - Where We Are Today

**What you're showing:** Current strengths, limitations, and real user reviews

**What to say:**
"Let's be honest about where Olam stands today. On the positive side: we have 140,000+ entries from two sources—our crowd-sourced Olam data and the Datuk corpus. We're open source, people trust us, and we have mobile apps.

But we also have clear limitations. We can't handle inflected forms—if you search for വാക്കിന് (an inflected form), you get nothing unless you know the root word വാക്ക്. We don't show etymology, pronunciation, or word relationships. And we haven't yet integrated the historic dictionaries sitting on gpura.org.

These aren't my complaints—these are from real users on Google Play. We have a 4.5-star rating with 5,400 reviews. Users love the open-source mission, but they want more words, better features, and improved UI."

**Key point:** We're not hiding our limitations. Users are telling us what's missing.

**If asked about data sources:** "Right now it's Olam English-Malayalam (58k+ entries) plus Datuk Malayalam-Malayalam (83k+ entries). The historic dictionaries like Gundert, Bailey, Sabdatharavali are digitized on gpura.org but not yet integrated."

---

## Slide 5: User Needs in 2025

**What you're showing:** Four user personas with specific needs

**What to say:**
"Dictionary users aren't a monolithic group. A language learner in Dubai needs mobile-first experience and pronunciation help. A linguist researcher needs etymology, corpus data, and exportable citations. A translator needs usage examples and register information. A developer needs API access and structured data.

No single feature satisfies everyone. That's why we need a modular, adaptive platform."

**Key point:** Different users need different things. One-size-fits-all doesn't work.

**Personas:**
1. **Language Learners** - Need simple lookups, pronunciation, examples
2. **Researchers** - Need etymology, morphology, semantic relations, citation formats
3. **Translators** - Need context, synonyms, collocations, register info
4. **Developers** - Need APIs, structured data, bulk downloads

---

## Slide 6: What Olam Could Become - A Vision

**What you're showing:** Six vision pillars and competitive advantages

**What to say:**
"So what could Olam become? Here are six pillars we're proposing:

1. **Intelligent Search** - Not just prominent search, but *smart* search that understands Malayalam morphology. Search for വാക്കിന്, get വാക്ക് automatically.

2. **Multi-Source Truth** - Show all dictionary sources with proper attribution. No monopoly, just transparent aggregation.

3. **Educational Scaffolding** - Help users learn Malayalam structure—morphology, etymology, relationships.

4. **Malayalam-First Design** - Authentic Malayalam content throughout, not English-centric.

5. **Community Ownership** - Keep it open source with transparent governance.

6. **AI Augmentation** - Use AI to amplify human expertise, not replace lexicographers.

What makes us unique? We're community-owned and Malayalam-focused. We have a path to integrate historic dictionaries. We're building for the AI era while preserving heritage."

**Key point:** These are possibilities, not decisions. We're asking if this feels right.

---

## Slide 7: Two Possible Evolution Phases

**What you're showing:** Olam 2.0 vs 3.0 features

**What to say:**
"We see two possible phases:

**Olam 2.0** (Year 1-2) would be the foundation: modern UX, multi-dictionary integration, linguistic features like morphology and etymology, visual semantic networks. This is achievable with existing tools.

**Olam 3.0** (Year 3-4) would add AI intelligence: personalized learning, semantic understanding beyond keywords, AI-assisted etymology research, contributor tools that scale. This requires more resources and emerging technology.

The key difference: 2.0 can be built with current team and tools. 3.0 needs expanded capacity and AI expertise."

**Key point:** There are incremental options. We don't have to do everything at once.

---

## Slide 8: Leveraging Existing Assets

**What you're showing:** What we currently have vs what's available for integration

**What to say:**
"We're not starting from zero. We currently have 140,000+ entries from Olam and Datuk. Available for integration: Gundert's historic dictionary, Bailey's 1849 work, Sabdatharavali, and Malayalam WordNet—all digitized on gpura.org.

We also have tools: mlmorph for morphology analysis, RaghuMalayalamSans font, our existing API, and GitHub infrastructure. And we have an active contributor community.

The question isn't whether these assets exist—they do. The question is: should we integrate them?"

**Key point:** The groundwork is already laid. We're asking if we should build on it.

---

## Slide 9: New Capabilities Needed

**What you're showing:** Technical and content requirements

**What to say:**
"To realize this vision, we'd need to build several new capabilities:

On the technical side: a dictionary aggregation engine, morphological search, semantic graph visualization, API infrastructure, and mobile-first responsive design.

On the content side: we'd need to curate and integrate historic dictionaries, develop etymology content, create pronunciation guides, and build corpus-based examples.

And we'd need modern UX: search-first interface, progressive disclosure of information, accessibility compliance, and personalization features.

These aren't impossible—but they require deliberate effort and resources."

**Key point:** Being realistic about what it takes to execute this vision.

---

## Slide 10: Mockup Showcase

**What you're showing:** Screenshots/descriptions of proposed interface

**What to say:**
"We've created interactive mockups to make this concrete. You can see what a word entry might look like with morphology alerts, etymology sections, semantic relationship graphs, and spelling guidance.

The mockups are available in the repository if you want to explore them. The goal is to show what's possible, not to dictate exact designs."

**Key point:** These are design explorations, not final specifications.

---

## Slide 11: Roadmap & Timeline

**What you're showing:** Four phases over 2+ years

**What to say:**
"If pursued, here's one possible roadmap:

**Phase 1** (Months 1-6): Foundation - set up infrastructure, integrate Gundert and Sabdatharavali, build core search.

**Phase 2** (Months 7-12): Enhanced Experience - add morphology search, etymology visualization, semantic relations.

**Phase 3** (Months 13-18): Intelligent Features - corpus analysis, ML-powered search, API v2.

**Phase 4** (Months 19-24): AI Integration - personalized learning, semantic understanding, scaling tools.

Key dependencies: We'd need 2-3 developers, a UX designer, a lexicographer, and community volunteers. Estimated budget for Phase 1-2 is roughly $100-150K. Phase 3-4 with AI might need $200-300K more."

**Key point:** This is a multi-year journey, not a quick project. And these are rough estimates.

**If asked about timeline:** "This assumes dedicated resources. With volunteer-only work, it would take longer."

---

## Slide 12: Key Questions for Stakeholders

**What you're showing:** Five decision areas for stakeholder consideration

**What to say:**
"We're not asking you to approve a plan today. We're asking five questions:

1. **Vision Alignment** - Does this feel right for Olam? Does it honor our open-source mission?

2. **Feasibility & Priority** - Is this the right project at the right time? What scale makes sense?

3. **Resources & Commitment** - Can we secure funding and team? Do we have volunteer capacity?

4. **Governance & Structure** - How should decisions be made? Who has authority?

5. **AI & Long-term** - Is AI integration worth planning for? Or should we focus near-term only?

These are genuine questions. Your answers will shape what happens next."

**Key point:** We're seeking stakeholder input, not approval for a predetermined plan.

---

## Slide 13: Open Discussion

**What you're showing:** Three discussion prompts

**What to say:**
"Let's open it up. We want to hear from you on three things:

**Does this feel right?** Does this vision honor Malayalam's richness while serving modern users? What resonates? What feels off?

**What scale makes sense?** Should we pursue the full vision, start smaller with incremental improvements, or take a different approach entirely?

**What are we missing?** What concerns should we address? What opportunities haven't we considered?

This is your project as much as it's ours. The decision belongs to the stakeholder community."

**Key point:** Genuinely invite dialogue. This is not a pitch—it's a conversation.

---

## General Presentation Tips

**Tone:** Consultative, not prescriptive. You're exploring possibilities, not selling a decision.

**Pacing:** 
- Slides 1-3: 2-3 minutes each (foundation setting)
- Slides 4-5: 4-5 minutes (current state and needs)
- Slides 6-7: 5-6 minutes (the vision—this is the heart)
- Slides 8-11: 3-4 minutes each (what it takes)
- Slide 12: 3-4 minutes (questions for stakeholders)
- Slide 13: Open discussion (however long needed)

**Total presentation:** 30-40 minutes before discussion

**What to emphasize:**
- Olam's 15-year legacy and community trust
- Real user feedback (not assumptions)
- Academic grounding in lexicography research
- Realistic about limitations and requirements
- Open to stakeholder direction

**What to avoid:**
- Acting like decisions are already made
- Minimizing the effort required
- Overselling AI capabilities
- Making it about technology instead of language and community

**Questions you might get:**

**"Why now?"**
"Malayalam language resources are growing—gpura.org has digitized historic dictionaries, mlmorph has matured, AI tools for language are emerging. And users are asking for these features. The timing feels right to ask the question, even if we decide to wait."

**"What if we can't get funding?"**
"Then we prioritize differently. Maybe we focus on data integration first without the fancy UX. Maybe we do it in smaller increments. Or maybe we decide it's not the right time. This presentation shows the full possibility—reality might be more modest."

**"Who owns this if we build it?"**
"That's a governance question for stakeholders to decide. We're proposing it stays community-owned, open source, with transparent decision-making. But the structure is up to you."

**"What about Wiktionary?"**
"Wiktionary is a valuable multilingual resource. Olam's focus is Malayalam-specific depth—integrating historic dictionaries, Malayalam-centric features, serving the Malayalam linguistic community specifically. There's room for both."

**"What about SMC partnership?"**
"We've removed partnership assumptions from this presentation. Those are conversations for stakeholders to have. We can use open-source tools like mlmorph without formal partnerships."

## Closing Thoughts

End with: "Olam has served the Malayalam community well for 15 years. This presentation asks: what should the next chapter look like? We don't know the answer—but we believe the conversation is worth having. Thank you for engaging with these ideas. Now let's discuss."

**After the presentation:** Take detailed notes on stakeholder feedback. The goal is to understand their perspectives, not to defend the proposal.
